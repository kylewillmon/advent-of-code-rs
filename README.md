# advent-of-code-rs
This repository contains my attempts at completing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in Rust. I
am definitely not currently an expert in Rust, so keep that in mind if you decide to read this code.

## Spoiler Alert
This should be obvious, but this repository does contain **SOLUTIONS** to Advent of Code puzzles. If you intend to
solvethose puzzles yourself, I would advise against looking at this code. If you're stuck and want to peek at how
someone else solved it, be my guest.

## aoclib
To assist myself, I have create a small Advent of Code library. It is fairly basic and there are much better options
out there if you [look around](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code). But I intentionally chose not to
use those and instead to write my own as a coding exercise.
